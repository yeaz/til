# Definition of Machine Learning

## Definition

*A computer program is said to learn to perform a **task T** from **experience E**, if its performance at task T, as measured by a **performance metric P**, improves with experience E over time.* - *Machine Learning* by Tom Mitchell

## Example

**Task T**: An artificial customer service provider can answer questions submitted by customers. 

**Experience E**: It could learn by looking at past question/answer logs generated by the customer service team. 

**Performance P**: Its capability can be measured by computing the percentage of correctly answered questions from real human customers.
